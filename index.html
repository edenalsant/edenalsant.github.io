				<p>Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card vermelho">
				<p>Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card verde">
				<p>Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. </p>

			<div class="card amarelo">
				<p>Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570–590 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity.</p>

					<p>loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly loving him is like trying to change your mind once you’re already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all  losing him was blue, like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met but loving him was red loving him was red  touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no right answer regretting him was like wishing you’d never found out that love could be that strong  losing him was blue, like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met but loving him was red oh, red burning red  remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it's time now, gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red  burning, it was red  oh, losing him was blue, like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met ‘cause loving him was red yeah, yeah, red oh, burning red  and that’s why he’s spinning ‘round in my head comes back to me burning red yeah, yeah  his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street</p>
