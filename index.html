					when your sorry head is filled with dope i hope you make it to the day you’re 28 years old you’re dripping like a saturated
					sunrise you’re spilling like an overflowing sink you’re ripped at every edge but you’re a masterpiece and now i’m tearing
					through the pages and the ink everything is blue his pills, his hands, his jeans and now i’m covered in the colors pull
					apart at the seams and it's blue and it's blue everything is grey his hair, his smoke, his dreams and now he's so devoid
					of color he don’t know what it means and he's blue and he's blue you were a vision in the morning when the light came
					through i know i’ve only felt religion when i’ve lied with you you said you’ll never be forgiven till your boys are
					too and i’m still waking every morning but it’s not with you you’re dripping like a saturated sunrise you’re spilling
					like an overflowing sink you’re ripped at every edge but you’re a masterpiece and now i’m tearing through the pages
					and the ink everything is blue his pills, his hands, his jeans and now i’m covered in the colors pull apart at the seams
					and it's blue and it's blue everything is grey his hair, his smoke, his dreams and now he's so devoid of color he don’t
					know what it means and he's blue and he's blue you were red, and you liked me 'cause i was blue but you touched me,
					and suddenly i was a lilac sky then you decided purple just wasn’t for you everything is blue his pills, his hands,
					his jeans and now i’m covered in the colors pull apart at the seams and it's blue and it's blue everything is grey his
					hair, his smoke, his dreams and now he's so devoid of color he don’t know what it means and he's blue and he's blue
					everything is blue everything is blue everything is blue everything is blue</p>

					your pictures you looked so good in green i hope you’re well and you look so good with him and i’m proud of you still
					i miss your perfect teeth i was too blunt i hope you feel happy that’s all i want mess in the kitchen i was so disappointed
					i guess i got to my head and i was too young to understand it i get it now that it’s too late i never stopped feeling
					guilty i’m over it, i promise that i just gotta sing it out of me you looked so good in green i hope you’re well and
					you look so good with him and i’m proud of you still take care of my shirt warm and red i hope you think of me still

				<p>loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
					loving him is like trying to change your mind once you’re already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn,
					so bright just before they lose it all losing him was blue, like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone
					forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met but loving him was red loving him was red touching
					him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all
					the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no
					right answer regretting him was like wishing you’d never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue,
					like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never
					met but loving him was red oh, red burning red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it's time
					now, gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red burning, it
					was red oh, losing him was blue, like i’d never known missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like trying
					to know somebody you’ve never met ‘cause loving him was red yeah, yeah, red oh, burning red and that’s why he’s spinning
					‘round in my head comes back to me burning red yeah, yeah his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street</p>
